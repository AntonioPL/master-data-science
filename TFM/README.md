# My Repository

Here you'll find some of the Data Science projecs i've been doing while studying the Master. 

You'll note that the jobs are higly specialized in the constrution field. 
That is because I work as an Architec Construction Manager. With these exercises, I am trying to use these techniques to improve performance at my job and to take better decissions.

All of my works are in "TFM", but only "CONSTADEX" file is the final project. In "TFM" file there are the following exercises:

- "Linkedin_BIM_Reasearch" : Research on how BIM is changing the construction roles.

- "Nube_Palabras" : Wordprocessing of the Book "Salto al BIM" to analyze the frequency of specifical words.The final result is some variations of a tag cloud with different sizes depending of their total amounts.

- "Eval_software": user experience evaluation of BIM software. Subscribers from Especialista3d.com gave their opinion throug the following form https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBzWWDonkwDrlcD9UZy-E3yGqHdDqQw2n1TmPV6OslnYjRXw/viewform . The result will be a research and some analitical charts.

- "CONSTADEX" : Main final project of the course. Explained better in the file README.
